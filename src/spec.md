# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Home page “Explore by Category” sub-icons to a professional, solid/filled, minimal black-and-white style consistent with the luxury theme, without changing layout or content.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the icon set/usage in `frontend/src/components/home/HomeCategoriesGrid.tsx` so all category icons use a consistent solid/filled minimal style.
- Ensure icon rendering is strictly black-and-white (no colored icon accents) while preserving the existing grid/card layout, spacing, category order/count, and text.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page, the “Explore by Category” section looks the same structurally, but all category icons appear clean, solid, minimal, and consistently black-and-white.
