# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Polish the UI to feel more luxurious and premium via a cinematic hero, refined navbar, deeper interactive cards, consistent button hovers, and an editorial font pairing.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home page hero to use a darker, cinematic premium background and apply a soft black gradient overlay for a high-class look while keeping text/CTA readable.
- Refine the sticky navbar styling by increasing desktop menu item spacing, increasing header padding, and adding a subtle drop shadow without changing navigation behavior (desktop/mobile).
- Enhance story cards across the app with a stronger soft shadow and smooth hover interaction (subtle lift/scale) without causing layout shift.
- Standardize button styling site-wide with consistent border radius and smooth 0.3s hover transitions aligned to the black luxury theme, without editing read-only `frontend/src/components/ui` sources.
- Apply a premium font pairing: serif for headings (h1–h6/heading components) and clean sans-serif for body text, consistently across all pages.

**User-visible outcome:** The site presents a more cinematic, high-end aesthetic: a darker luxury hero with overlay, a roomier and more dimensional navbar, cards that feel deeper and interactive on hover, buttons with consistent refined hover behavior, and a premium editorial typography system throughout.
