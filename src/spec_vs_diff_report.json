  "summary": "Implemented the requested UI polish items: updated the Home hero to a darker cinematic image with a black gradient overlay, refined sticky navbar spacing/padding with a subtle shadow, enhanced StoryCard and LuxuryFeaturedStoryCard shadows + hover lift, added global 0.3s transitions for interactive elements, and introduced a serif/sans premium font pairing loaded via Google Fonts. However, the diff also changes global theme color tokens (e.g., setting a “Royal Blue accent” primary and adding gold/chart tokens), which was not explicitly requested and may exceed the scope of hero/navbar/cards/buttons/typography polish.",
