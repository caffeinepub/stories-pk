  "summary": "Implemented new /terms, /login, and /signup routes/pages; updated Home hero/banner to requested headline/CTA with subtle gradient background; added a manual featured-stories carousel; added Header/Footer navigation entries. Some acceptance-criteria details are not fully met (mobile nav link implementation and post-auth redirect behavior).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "All new navigation links (including mobile menu) should use TanStack Router <Link> components and match existing hover/active styling patterns; header must include a Terms link on both desktop and mobile menus.",
      "reason": "Header desktop uses <Link>, but the mobile menu renders navigation items as <button> elements that call navigate() rather than using TanStack Router <Link> components (including the Terms entry). This does not meet the AC requirement that new links use the existing Link components on desktop and mobile.",

      "requirement": "After successful login/signup, redirect the user to an appropriate page (at minimum Home, or the originally attempted page if that context is available).",
      "reason": "Login and Signup pages always redirect to '/' after successful authentication; there is no evidence of capturing/using an attempted-route context for redirecting back to the originally requested page.",
